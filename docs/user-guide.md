## What is Intent-Based Trading?

Intent-based trading represents a paradigm shift from traditional DEX interactions. Instead of specifying exact execution paths, you simply express your desired outcome, and our network of competitive solvers finds the best way to achieve it.

### Key Benefits

- **üéØ Simplified UX**: One signature for complex trades
- **üèÜ Best Execution**: Competitive solver network ensures optimal pricing
- **‚ö° Atomic Settlement**: Your constraints are enforced on-chain
- **üîí MEV Protection**: Reduced exposure to front-running and sandwich attacks
- **üí∞ Cost Efficient**: Optimized gas usage and better prices

### Traditional vs Intent-Based Trading

| Traditional DEX | Intent-Based Trading |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Specify exact route | Express desired outcome |
| Multiple signatures | Single signature |
| Manual slippage management | Automatic optimization |
| Exposed to MEV | MEV protection |
| Fixed execution path | Dynamic optimization |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  "nativeCurrency": {
    "name": "OKB",
    "symbol": "OKB",
    "decimals": 18
  },
  "blockExplorerUrls": ["https://www.oklink.com/xlayer"]
}
```

### Understanding the Intent Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Sign Intent] --> B[Broadcast to Solvers]
    B --> C[Solvers Compete]
    C --> D[Best Bid Selected]
    D --> E[Atomic Settlement]
    E --> F[Tokens Received]
```

1. **Intent Broadcasting** (Instant)
   - Your signed intent is broadcast to all registered solvers
   - Real-time WebSocket updates show solver activity

2. **Solver Competition** (2-3 seconds)
   - Solvers analyze your intent and submit competing bids
   - You'll see bids appear in real-time with:
     - Expected output amount
     - Solver fee
     - Estimated execution time

3. **Automatic Selection** (Instant)
   - The system automatically selects the best bid based on:
     - Highest output amount for you
     - Lowest total cost
     - Solver reputation score

4. **Settlement** (10-30 seconds)
   - The winning solver executes the trade atomically
   - Smart contract enforces your constraints
   - Tokens are delivered to your specified address

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What makes intent-based trading different?**

A: Traditional DEXs require you to specify exactly how to execute your trade (which pools, routes, etc.). With intent-based trading, you simply specify what you want to achieve, and our network of solvers competes to find the best execution path for you.

**Q: Is my money safe?**

A: Yes. You only sign an intent (not a transaction), and our smart contracts enforce your constraints atomically. Your tokens never leave your wallet until the exact moment you receive what you requested.

**Q: How much does it cost?**

A: You pay:
- Solver fees (typically 0.05% - 0.3% of trade amount)
- Gas fees (paid by the solver, but reflected in the final price)
- No additional protocol fees

### Trading Questions

**Q: How long does a trade take?**

A: Typical timeline:
- Intent creation: Instant
- Solver bidding: 2-3 seconds
- Settlement: 10-30 seconds
- Total: Usually under 1 minute

**Q: What happens if no one bids on my intent?**

A: Your intent will expire after the deadline with no cost to you. This is rare but can happen for:
- Very small amounts
- Exotic token pairs
- Extreme market conditions

**Q: Can I cancel an intent?**

A: Intents cannot be cancelled once signed, but they automatically expire after the deadline. Future versions may include cancellation features.

**Q: What's the minimum trade size?**

A: There's no hard minimum, but very small trades (under $10) may not attract solver bids due to gas costs exceeding potential profits.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which tokens are supported?**

A: Any ERC-20 token on X Layer with sufficient liquidity. The interface shows available tokens, and solvers determine if they can execute your specific trade.

**Q: How is the price determined?**

A: Solvers compete to offer you the best price by:
- Aggregating across multiple DEXs
- Optimizing routing strategies
- Factoring in gas costs and fees
- Competing for solver rewards

**Q: What if the market moves against me during settlement?**

A: Your intent includes slippage protection. If the market moves beyond your specified slippage tolerance, the settlement will fail and you'll need to create a new intent.

**Q: Can I trade with partial fills?**

A: Currently, all intents are all-or-nothing. Partial fills are not supported, but this feature is planned for future releases.

### Security Questions

**Q: How do I know the smart contracts are secure?**

A: Our smart contracts have been:
- Audited by professional security firms
- Tested extensively with automated testing
- Open-sourced for community review
- Deployed with time-locks and upgrade controls

**Q: What data do you collect?**

A: We collect minimal data:
- Public wallet addresses for functionality
- Trade data for analytics (anonymized)
- No personal information or private keys
- Full privacy policy available at [privacy.intendly.xyz]

**Q: What happens if the website is down?**

A: The smart contracts continue operating independently. Solvers can still settle existing intents, and you can interact directly with contracts if needed.

### Solver Questions

**Q: How are solvers selected?**

A: The system automatically selects the bid that provides:
1. The highest output amount for you
2. The lowest effective cost
3. From a solver with good reputation

**Q: What if a solver fails to settle?**

A: If settlement fails:
- You keep your original tokens
- The solver may be penalized
- You can immediately create a new intent
- No cost to you

**Q: Can anyone become a solver?**

A: Yes! Solver participation is permissionless. Check our [Solver Guide](./solver-guide.md) for details on running a solver.
